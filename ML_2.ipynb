    "Email Spam Detection (KNN & SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Concept:\n",
    "Email spam detection is a binary classification problem where emails are labeled as Spam (1) or Not Spam (0) based on their content or metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing:\n",
    "The email text is cleaned by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters. Then, it is converted into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF or Bag of Words, enabling machine learning models to process the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN classifies a new email by looking at the ‘K’ closest samples in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority label among these neighbors determines the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s simple and effective for small datasets but slower for large data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine (SVM):\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM finds the best hyperplane that separates spam and non-spam emails in a high-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works well with text data and is robust against overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Evaluation:\n",
    "Models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.\n",
    "SVM often gives higher accuracy and better generalization than KNN due to its margin-based optimization."
